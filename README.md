# \# Stats UI Viewer for an RPG Game



This is a simple Stats UI system for a text-based RPG. It displays player stats, active status effect (like buffs or debuffs), 

and currently equipped gear in a structured and readable format.



### \## Features

&nbsp;- Displays all core player stats: health, mana, strength, defense, speed, luck, and experience.

&nbsp;- Shows current status effect with remaining duration.

&nbsp;- Equipment management: equip and unequip weapons and armor.

&nbsp;- Visual breakdown of gear slots and what's currently equipped.



### \## Future updates/TODOs

&nbsp;- Add the ability to swap equipment directly.

&nbsp;- Add stat change indicators:

&nbsp;   - Green for stat increases

&nbsp;   - Red for stats decreases

&nbsp;- Possibly display tier system (e.g., "Novice", "Warrior:, "Champion", etc) in the stats panel.

&nbsp;- Consider modularizing for integration into larger combat systems or character creators.
